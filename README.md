## What is it about

A small framework & library which is designed to build method-invocation-like service and client 
supporting many protocols and transports, such as native services, restful/http, websocket, and RPCs, 
especially in a **isomorphic** way. By destructing all the building blocks and unifying them in a 
isomorphic and constrained way, Node.js native services, restful APIs and Microservices can be built
productively and testing-easily in the same way, even the client SDKs can be completed simultaneously.
It's designed to be DRY for **productivity** and **quality**.
